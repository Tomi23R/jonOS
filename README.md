# jonOS
jonOS is a basic OS for Raspberry Pi (ARM) that allow build embedded systems for high performance environments.

This project define a new architecture for operating systems that takes the main characteristics of other architectures such as Embedded OS, OS as library, High Performance OS, monotasking OS and mix it with the idea os a iterative server. 

The performance results of this architecture compared with Rasbian (Debian based OS designed for Raspberry Pi) achieve the following times in CPU time, real time and network time:
